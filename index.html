    <section id="bio"> <h1>Hi!</h1> <div class="line"></div>
        <p>As I  mentioned above my hobby is to listen to songs i like to hear calm song that make my mind calm down or you can say cool.
      And other times like when i am in a car or playing games i mostly like beat song songs like hip-hop. Hip-hop song make me feel that i am in that thing and enjoying it. Calm song make my relax like old aged peaple listen you can say it. I got a whole bunch of things to say right now but i think it is time for me to go we will countinue next time till then see ya..</p> </section> 
    
    <h1>My Favourite Character Is <br><span id="name">My Father</span>
    
        <p> My Father is a hard working man and a business man. Everyone in start as they are talking of there father they say this but my father is really like this. My father never says no to me or my sister's or brother's. He only says yes to things that we say to bring or buy. I think everytime to be like him to be intelligent , to know everything around you . He his a different type of father , I have seen many different father's that they dont really see on there children's they only think like let them do whatever do what they are doing they dont focus on them. For now we have to say if Time is there then hope is . I dont know or on one knows what is future or what am I goign to be like. So for now again bye.  </p>
